# ⚖️ The Aequitas Charter (Chartre Fondatrice)

The Aequitas protocol is governed by five immutable pillars that ensure justice, stability, and longevity. This charter is the law of the network.

## 1. The Principle of Equity (Répartition Équitable)
Wealth creation must benefit those who secure the network.
*   **Miner Reward**: **98%** of every block goes directly to the miner who discovered it.
*   **Protocol Sustainability**: **2%** is allocated to the Aequitas Treasury for long-term development.
*   **Zero Pre-mine**: No coins were created before the public launch. Every single AEQ in existence was earned through work.

## 2. Intrinsic Stability (Le Stablecoin Décentralisé)
Aequitas is a **Stablecoin by Nature**, not by Peg.
*   **Fiat Independence**: Unlike "stable" coins indexed to USD or EUR (which lose value to inflation), Aequitas is indexed only to the mathematical difficulty of its production.
*   **Universal Value**: Because it is not tied to any failing currency, Aequitas maintains an **absolute value anchor** in the digital realm. It cannot lose value to external monetary shifts.

## 3. Inclusive Mining (Accès Universel)
Mining should be as easy as "cleaning up" (ménage).
*   **ASIC Resistance**: Our AequiHash algorithm is designed to prevent the centralization of power in massive server farms.
*   **Consumer Hardware**: Every home user with a standard GPU (RTX series) can participate and profit.

## 4. Absolute Transparency
The code is the law.
*   The entire supply and every transaction is publicly auditable.
*   No hidden minting, no backdoor access, no inflation beyond the 210M hard cap.

## 5. Global Decentralization
*   Aequitas has no center. It exists everywhere the Kademlia DHT reaches.
*   The network is designed to survive global internet disruptions through peer-to-peer resilience.
