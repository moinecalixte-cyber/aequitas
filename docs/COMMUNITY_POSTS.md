**Title**: [Showcase] AEQUITAS - A decentralised blockchain built entirely in Rust using libp2p and tokio.

**Content**:
Hey everyone,

I've been working on a new blockchain project called **Aequitas** (Latin for Equity). Most modern cryptos are heavily centralized, so I wanted to build something that feels like the early days of Bitcoin—where anyone can mine with a simple GPU.

**Tech Stack**:
- **libp2p**: Used for global P2P networking with Kademlia DHT and Gossipsub.
- **Tokio**: Powering the asynchronous RPC and consensus layers.
- **AequiHash**: A custom memory-hard algorithm to keep ASICs away and favor consumer GPUs (RTX 3060+).

**Why it's interesting**:
- 0% Pre-mine.
- No central authority.
- Real-time web dashboard built into the node.

I'm looking for peer reviews on the network implementation and contributors interested in decentralization.

**Roadmap**: P2P Mesh ✅, Global DHT ✅, GUI Wallet (Next 🚀)

**Title**: Introducing Aequitas: The GPU-Only Coin with no Pre-mine and no VCs.

**Content**:
Aequitas is a pure PoW (Proof of Work) project designed for fairness.

In a world of pre-printed tokens and VC-backed chains, Aequitas returns to the roots:
1. **GPU-Mining**: Memory-hard hashing keeps the network accessible to regular users.
2. **Fair Launch**: The genesis block was just launched. No developer fee, no treasury lockups.
3. **Rust-Powered**: Built for safety and speed.

If you have a GPU and care about decentralization, come join the mesh.
